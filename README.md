## Know Elements 

[Understand boxes](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/boxes/) where everything is a box on a web page. To confirm this, open a web page and then try to inspect the elements of the web page.   

----

## HTML 
[HTML tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)   
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) online playground for HTML.   

----

## CSS 

[Tailwind playground for CSS, try this](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) and [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)   

[Sample product/tool page](https://stupendous-lollipop-54242c.netlify.app/) uses HTML, Tailwind, Astro, Netlify-build, and GitHub repo.    

----

## JavaScript

[RunJS playground for JavaScript](https://runjs.app/) to check syntax and basic testing of the script.   

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) for side-by-side HTML, CSS, and Javascript editor windows to visualize code for web apps.

## Database

[Railway.app](https://railway.app/) - simple to start PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB instance in cloud in minutes.    

----

## APIs

It has become imperative for developers to understand and design APIs to connect or integrate with so many other software or services.    

Here is an online book on [API-first world](https://api-first-world.com/) to emphasize API-first initiatives to produce and consume software and services. The way we consume APIs for bank payment gateways, online payments (UPI, stripe, etc.), and user messaging (SMS, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.), for large software to survive with rapid changes in technologies, designers, and developers should pay attention to API-first approach if the software/service is online.    

[OpenAPI specification for RESTful APIs](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/)

## Troubleshooting 

[Can I use](https://caniuse.com/) - to see browser support for front-end web technologies. For example, look for [querySelector](https://caniuse.com/?search=querySelector)   

[Update node js version](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version)  

[SSR web frameworks](https://simply-how.com/server-side-rendering-web-frameworks), [SSR with React](https://blog.openreplay.com/server-side-rendering-ssr-with-react), another [example](https://frontend.blog/building-an-ssr-framework-using-vite-prisma/)     

[Browser permissions](https://permission.site/) to simulate how the browser asks certain permissions courtesy to [Felt](https://adrifelt.github.io/demos/).   

----

## Security  

Pay attention to security aspects while you develop portals. Security of web applications should not be an afterthought or left to other teams. Utilize free tools and websites for OSINT or Web Intelligence (WebINT). These steps could improve the ranking of your websites/portals.     

Check your website's [HTTP response headers](https://securityheaders.com/), [TLS certificates (X.509)](https://censys.io/cert-hygiene-and-website-availability/), (vulnerable) libraries used, consider VAPT, etc.
